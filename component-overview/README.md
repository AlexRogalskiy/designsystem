# Component overview

This package might only be useful if you are a contributing developer or if you
want to build a documentation framework for our designsystem.

We just had to build our own framework for previewing components.

## package `@sb1/ffe-component-overview`

You probably won't need this.
The package contains some named exports:

-   `examples` - compiled code examples from `./examples/`
-   `reactDoc` - output of react-docgen
-   `packages` - list of all packages

Also there is `lib/style.css` with everything.
