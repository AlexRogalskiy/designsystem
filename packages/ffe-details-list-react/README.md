# @sb1/ffe-details-list-react

**NOTE: This package does not use the `@sb1/ffe-details-list` package**

The `@sb1/ffe-details-list` package is deprecated and kept around for legacy reasons. This React component uses the
`@sb1/ffe-grid`-package to attain the same design and behavior, without the need for any extra LESS packages. This way, the
`@sb1/ffe-details-list` components can be used in connection to other `ffe-grid`-based components.

## Install

```
npm install --save @sb1/ffe-details-list-react
```

## Usage

Included less file to your imports:

```css
@import 'node_modules/@sb1/ffe-details-list-react/less/ffe-details-list-react';
```

Run Styleguidist from the repository root to see live examples and documentation,
or see the markdown files next to the component code in `src/`.
