# Divider line

OgsÃ¥ kjent som _horizontal rule_, eller _thematic break_ i HTML-verden.

Fra [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr):

> The HTML <hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements
> (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section);
> historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may
> still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now
> defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to
> draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.

```js
<DividerLine />
```
