# 2.0.0 (2018-01-12)

### Chores

* **ffe-expandable-react:** Import ffe-expandable-react

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ffe-expandable-react:** This commit removes the original implementation,
and creates a new major of ffe-expandable-react, which simply
works as a proxy for `react-collapse`. The package is deprecated,
and kept around for legacy reasons.
