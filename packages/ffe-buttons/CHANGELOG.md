# 5.1.0 (2017-12-22)

### Features

* **ffe-buttons:** Add contribute.md link to readme ([e0e3d2c](***REMOVED***))

## 5.0.1

* Fix unnecessary duplicate nesting of `--loading`-modifier.

# 5.0.0

* Replaced hardcoded font-sizes with mixins from ffe-core

### BREAKING CHANGES

* BREAKING: peerDependency to `ffe-core` bumped to new major

# 4.2.0

### Features

* Add `ffe-task-button` as a new button type. Should be used for any action where the user is adding a new item to some kind of collection. It's not opinionated about what icon to use, but was designed with `pluss-ikon` from `ffe-icons` in mind.

# 4.1.0

### Features

* Add `--inline` modifier to ffe-button-group. When using this modifier, the buttons in the modified button group will not have width 100% on small screens,
and will be displayed on the same line as long as there is enough horizontal space.

## 4.0.4

* Support both versions 9 and 10 of `ffe-core`

## 4.0.3

* Replaced hardcoded transition properties with variables from ffe-core

## 4.0.2

* Add line-height to buttons to remove implicit dependency on ffe-body-text
* Add multiline example for ffe-action-button

## 4.0.1

* Fixed `active` and `focus` state of the chevron in `ffe-shortcut-button--condensed`.

# 4.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

Bumped peer dependency version of ffe-core. No external API change, but this version requires a new major of `ffe-core`

* Renamed color names to stay in sync with refactoring in ffe-core@9.x
* Updated visual test baselines according to color changes in ffe-core

To migrate, update your app to ffe-core version 9.x

# 3.0.0

* Made `ffe-back-button` work with `<a />` elements.
* Made `ffe-tertiary-button` work with `<a />` elements.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* BREAKING: `ffe-back-button` is now a `display: inline-block` element, which might break some layouts.
Migrating should be pretty simple though - if you were depending on `ffe-back-button` to be a block level
element, please wrap your element in a block level element, like a `<div />`.

## 2.5.7

* Removed use of `line-height` to set button height, instead use `padding`. This so line breaks won't look awkward - with padding around every text row.

## 2.5.6

* Changed primary button background color to @ffe-blue-royal-light-wcag

## 2.5.5

* According to Bodil Egge, icons in buttons are 14x14 px in "verkt√∏ykassa", not 18x18 px. This change only affects the size of the icon, the button's outer dimensions are not changed.

## 2.5.4

* Fix visual bug with icons in buttons in IE by explicitly setting label icon width.

## 2.5.3

* The chevron icon does not need to have the inline style `transform:rotate(-90deg)` anymore.

## 2.5.2

* Add `outline: 0` to `.ffe-primary-button:focus` to avoid "double" focus in Firefox.

## 2.5.1

* Fix position of spinner in condensed buttons.
* Minor placement adjustment of icons in secondary and tertiary buttons (this time with help from professionals).

# 2.5.0

* Adjust odd placement of icons in secondary buttons.

### Features

* Icons can be nested inside tertiary buttons with `.ffe-tertiary-button__label-icon`.
This also requires `.ffe-tertiary-button--with-icon` on the button.

# 2.4.0

### Features

* Icons can be nested inside secondary buttons with `.ffe-secondary-button__label-icon`.

# 2.3.0

### Features

* Add compact variant of action, primary, secondary, tertiary and shortcut button (modifier `--condensed`).

# 2.2.0

### Features

* Added ffe-back-button

## 2.1.4

* Updated design of ffe-tertiary-button

## 2.1.3

* Add `fill: @ffe-blue-royal-light-wcag;` to `.ffe-shortcut-button__icon-chevron` so it's no longer black by default.
* Fix broken selector for `:hover` state of `.ffe-shortcut-button__icon-chevron`.

## 2.1.2

* Add `cursor: pointer;` to `.ffe-tertiary-button`

## 2.1.1

* Improve `.ffe-button-group` to use less fragile selectors

# 2.1.0

### Features

* Added `ffe-button-group` _by popular demand_

# 2.0.0

* Bump ffe-core devDependency to new major  ^8.0.2

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Bump ffe-core peerDependency to new major ^8.0.2

## 1.0.1

Added mixins that will be removed in ffe-core@8.0.0.

# 1.0.0

First version of package. Code was previously in `ffe-core`, but separated to its own package in ffe-core@8.0.0.
