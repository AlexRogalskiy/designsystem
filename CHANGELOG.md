#CHANGELOG

## Version 1.2.0
* Increased padding right for accordion-toggler to make sure arrow does end on top of toggler-content

## Version 1.1.1
* Removed default padding from `<ul>` element as this counters the centering given by `margin: 0 auto;`

## Version 1.1.0
* Removed list style dots (list-style: none) as this shouldn't be pushed to the consumer app

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial version of ffe-accordion. Supports both blue and white version.
