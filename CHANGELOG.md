# CHANGELOG

## Version 1.3.3
* Add a few minor style changes to the toggler, to make it possible to use either an `<a>` or a `<button>` tag with the same visual results.
* Updated all examples to use a `<button>`, as it makes the most sense semantically.

## Version 1.3.2
* Remove .accordion-item bottom margin for white accordions that was introduced in 1.3.1.

## Version 1.3.1
* Design changes, including normalizing content and title padding, removing text-decoration and correcting colors

## Version 1.3.0
* Add visual tests and examples

## Version 1.2.0
* Increased padding right for accordion-toggler to make sure arrow does end on top of toggler-content

## Version 1.1.1
* Removed default padding from `<ul>` element as this counters the centering given by `margin: 0 auto;`

## Version 1.1.0
* Removed list style dots (list-style: none) as this shouldn't be pushed to the consumer app

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial version of ffe-accordion. Supports both blue and white version.
