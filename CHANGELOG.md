### Breaking changes

Bumped peer dependency version of ffe-core. No external API change, but this version requires a new major of `ffe-core`

To migrate, update your app to ffe-core version 9.x

## v.3.1.0
* Added support for 0 column size

## v.3.0.1
* Bugfix: `.ffe-grid__row-wrapper` now treats columns that wrap to more than one row correctly

## v.3.0.0
* Breaking: `.ffe-grid__row--bg-sand` and `.ffe-grid__row--bg-blue` now require a `.ffe-grid__row-wrapper` around its columns. The background will then be full width while the content keeps to the grid size.
```html
<div class="ffe-grid__row ffe-grid__row--bg-sand ffe-grid__row--top-padding">
  <div class="ffe-grid__row-wrapper">
      <div class="ffe-grid__col--md-6">
          <div class="ffe-grid__content"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="ffe-grid__col--md-6">
          <div class="ffe-grid__content"></div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
