# Changelog

## v.2.0.1

* Updated "main"-entry in package.json with correct path

## v.2.0.0
* Breaking:
  * renamed `less/description-list.less` to `less/description-list.less`
  * renamed `less/list.less` to `less/regular-lists.less`
  * moved entry-point `ffe-lists.less` to `less/lists.less`

This is consistent with how `.less` files are named similar to their package names in the other packages that were exported from core.
