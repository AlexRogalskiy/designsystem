# Changelog

## 3.0.4

### üêõ Bugfixes

* Reverts the ffe-core major version bump as it causes builds to break for consumers who have not upgraded
to the new ffe-core major.

## v.3.0.3
* Bumped ffe-core version, made minor adjustments to sync with the latest color setup

## v.3.0.2
* Fix visual IE bug. When wrapping DescriptionList in a ffe-grid (because flex in flex?) the DescriptionList will not take full width (not even close). Thus we specify full width for DescriptionList.

## v.3.0.1
* Added `--sm-2-cols` modifier to support 2 columns on small screens in `ffe-description-list-multicol`

## v.3.0.0
* Breaking:
  * Refactored and renamed description lists in order to more correctly follow BEM naming convention
  	* Renamed `ffe-description-list--flex` to `ffe-description-list`
  	* Renamed `ffe-description-list--multicolumn` to `ffe-description-list-multicol`
  * Removed `ffe-number-list` (use `ffe-numbered-list`)
  * Removed `ffe-stylized-number-list` (use `ffe-stylized-numbered-list`)
* Added `--md` and `--lg` modifiers for `ffe-description-list`

## v.2.3.0
* Added `--bg-sand` modifier for `ffe-check-list`

## v.2.2.0
* Added aliases `.ffe-numbered-list` for `.ffe-number-list` and `.ffe-stylized-numbered-list` for `ffe-stylized-number-list`

## v.2.1.0
* Added `ffe-check-list`
* Added `ffe-stylized-number-list`

## v.2.0.1

* Updated "main"-entry in package.json with correct path

## v.2.0.0
* Breaking:
  * renamed `less/description-list.less` to `less/description-list.less`
  * renamed `less/list.less` to `less/regular-lists.less`
  * moved entry-point `ffe-lists.less` to `less/lists.less`

This is consistent with how `.less` files are named similar to their package names in the other packages that were exported from core.
